# esp32-cam-enclosure
The Snap did not work as well as intended and I did not have time to iterate the design. I used hot glue just so the box remains accessible. The slots for the headers were also to thin and required modification, I just opened them using my soldering iron.
Oversize slots by antother 3mm w.r.t. center of slot (1.5mm each side) and should be okay.
